this is a spontaneous case report received from a physician in united states on (b)(4) 2014 which refers to a female patient of unspecified age who had essure (fallopian tube occlusion insert) inserted for sterilization. patient was complaining of left quadrant pain since the essure was inserted, and was requesting removal. the physician did a bilateral salpingectomy on (b)(6) 2014. patient's left tube was left intact since the physician felt the essure was in the outer lumen of the tube. ptc investigation result was received on (b)(4) 2014. this adverse event report is related to a product technical complaint (ptc). the bayer reference number for the ptc report is: (b)(4). final assessment: since no product was returned to us for investigation, we were unable to perform an investigation of the actual device involved in this complaint. typically, we would inspect the micro-insert to confirm that all parts are accounted for and inspect the device to look for any manufacturing deficiencies. since we have no valid lot number for this case, we were unable to conduct a review of the manufacturing batch record. we are unable to confirm any quality defect or device malfunction at this time. medical assessment: this ptc was initiated due to a request for confirmation of quality. the reported adverse events are known possible undesirable events and not indicative of a quality defect per se. no batch number was reported. without this information no batch signal cluster review in the (b)(4) database for a more detailed statistical medical evaluation is possible. no complaint sample was provided for further technical investigation. the technical assessment concluded "unconfirmed quality defect". in summary, there is no reason to suspect a causal relationship to a potential quality deficit based on this report. company causality comment: this medically confirmed spontaneous case report refers to a female patient, who had essure (fallopian tube occlusion insert) inserted and experienced left quadrant pain since essure insertion and requested the device removal. the physician then initiated a bilateral salpingectomy and during the procedure, he felt the left essure was in the outer lumen of the tube, so the left tube was left intact. the first event, interpreted as pelvic pain, and other one, seen as device dislocation, are serious due medical importance. the events are listed in the reference safety information for essure. abdominal, pelvic and uncharacterized pain may occur with essure therapy. also, during essure micro-insert therapy there is a risk that the device could move out of fallopian tubes, this movement could be an expulsion (into uterus or out of the body), migration (distal fallopian tube or peritoneal cavity) or occur as a result of a fallopian tube perforation. considering that,in this case, the pain was probably caused per left device dislocation into the tube and this pain led to a bilateral salpingectomy (required intervention), the causality between the events and essure use is assessed as related and regarded as incident. product technical complaint (ptc) analysis concluded to an unconfirmed quality defect. medical ptc assessment considered that, based on the available information, there is no reason to suspect quality defect of the product (lot number was not provided). further information and product technical analysis (with lot number) are being sought. follow-up information received from physician on 03-feb-2015. the patient�s initials and date of birth were updated (she was (b)(6) at time of event). essure was placed in (b)(6) 2009 by another physician. on (b)(6) 2014, an ultrasound was done and was normal. on (b)(6) 2014, salpingectomy was done and both essure devices were removed by patient�s request. during surgery, left device appeared extra luminal. the patient recovered from removal procedure and her symptoms/pain resolved. physician described that the condition was possible related to essure since pain resolved after removal extra luminal device. company causality comment: this medically confirmed spontaneous case report refers to a female patient, who had essure (fallopian tube occlusion insert) inserted and experienced left quadrant pain since essure insertion and requested the device removal. the physician then initiated a bilateral salpingectomy and

led to a bilateral salpingectomy (required intervention), the causality between the events and essure use is assessed as related and regarded as incident. product technical complaint (ptc) analysis concluded to an unconfirmed quality defect. medical ptc assessment considered that, based on the available information, there is no reason to suspect quality defect of the product. no further information is expected..]]></TEXT>
